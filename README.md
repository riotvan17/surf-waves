# Project description
Wave Analysis and Forecasting for the Belgian Coast

The project result is a website that predicts coastal 
wave high with live web-scraped data. This is achieved 
by creating a Machine Learning model based on historical
data and deploying the result on Heroku with 
help from Docker hosted on GCP.
